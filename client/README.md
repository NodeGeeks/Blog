Ultimate Goal: Turn this blogging platform into a system where websites can signup to use this platform, more planning is needed, one thing to think of is since we will have one centralized login system for all the applications we build with we will need to a new property to profiles called 'applications' and each 'application' has a belongsTo to the app, along with there app info/settings, things like roles will need to be moved to the application level instead of profile level.
